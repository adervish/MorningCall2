1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
lucy tang: It's a test.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:14.739
Eric Domb: Apparently. There's Zoom has a new yeah, is summarization tool. I've been meaning to try. We tried a different like a third party one before that was not good.

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:23.229
Yaroslav: Yeah, we're gonna try to multi shot it and give it a bunch of examples of notes and see if we can get it to

4
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.390
Eric Domb: produce something that's more like what we're looking for.

5
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.179
Eric Domb: Too bad we don't have

6
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.240
Eric Domb: recordings of our calls.

7
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.890
Eric Domb: That'd be great training data

8
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.040
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: art.

9
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.970
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: I'm I'm not sure because I wouldn't train it. We just multi shot it. But the other.

10
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.620
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: I think what we'd like to get to is to hire Tomas's company to

11
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.629
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: listen to the calls, create a

12
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.559
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: summary and save nothing.

13
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.870
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co:  because I don't think we want to save it on an ongoing basis.

14
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.640
Eric Domb: No.

15
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.130
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: thanks.

16
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.149
Eric Domb: Carson's last day is Friday. So you can get that going by Monday.

17
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.920
Carson Trail: Why does it keep switching my video off?

18
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.340
Carson Trail: Okay, now, it works

19
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.700
Karen Legotte: anything exciting happening. I'm in the car driving.

20
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:22.380
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: You guys saw what they using to do with the Chinese Evs. I saw that they're looking at china subsidizing

21
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.230
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Evs.

22
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.229
lucy tang: It seems like what Yaroslav proposed might could play out. Might play out

23
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.229
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Nick fit. Just put a tariff on it.

24
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.410
lucy tang: Oh, if there's price, I mean, if they're now no longer super cheap.

25
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.529
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: they'll still be super cheap.

26
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.729
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: If you take an $11,000

27
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.270
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co:  view id seagull.

28
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.229
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: and you put a 30% tariff on it. It's still probably the cheapest car in Europe.

29
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.499
Karen Legotte: Daca, the cheapest car in Europe, is a Daca

30
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.710
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: sandero, which is $11,000,

31
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.870
Karen Legotte: maybe Mitsubishi.

32
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:56.689
Karen Legotte: Did you guys see the thing about diesel in Australia that they are running out of Diesel because their fires have closed and they can't extract the lithium needed for batteries, and it could be

33
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.539
Karen Legotte: problem if they can't

34
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.500
Karen Legotte: continue to process.

35
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.410
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: You're saying that the lithium mines in Australia use Diesel and Australia is running out of Diesel.

36
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.470
Karen Legotte: Yes, refined, refined Diesel, they can't. It has to be imported from Singapore

37
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:28.690
Karen Legotte: and Korea. and they don't have any refining capability in the country, and all of their extraction and mining is dependent upon Diesel fuel.

38
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.469
Eric Domb: What did something happen?

39
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.030
Eric Domb: Why why are they all of a sudden Diesel?

40
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:44.739
Karen Legotte: Well, 3 of their plants have been decommissioned, and they haven't put any new money into a plant so like one plant closed in like 18. Another plant closed.

41
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.670
Karen Legotte: I there's a ho! A whole series of their plans coming offline, and they haven't put new money into it because they were

42
00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:02.500
Karen Legotte: just easily transporting it. But it takes 2 weeks for it to get to them. And now, with supply chain issues since the pandemic. It's becoming more of a problem, but they still haven't made any investments.

43
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.209
Karen Legotte: This is broadly that

44
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.109
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: the rig and see drill

45
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.410
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: thesis.

46
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.880
Karen Legotte: So are you long that stock

47
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:30.950
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: I bought both of them. Yeah. And I think I'm gonna buy this one called Diamond, too. Well, they're not diesels in Australia specifically. And and maybe you're right that the refiners are the place that's been under invested. But,

48
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:48.650
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: the the the broad claim is that nobody's invested in any hydrocarbon based energy source for a couple of years and and that the you know us is the largest petroleum exporter in the world. Or

49
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:57.169
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: produce no largest producer in the world, and that still is, and but the you know, the the

50
00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:23.449
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: the the shale gas stuff, the shale oil you know, has this really steep decline curve. So like all of that's declining, nobody's invested in capacity. And at the same time all of these technological advances and standardization of offshore have brought the cost of looking for oil offshore down to about the same price as the shale. People are very close to it, and nobody's bought ships

51
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:40.010
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: in years. There aren't that many drill rigs. And so, as people you know, finally start to look for oil again, to replace the decline curves from the onshore shale. You can see

52
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:52.420
Karen Legotte: 85. Something like that, I think. What you want to look at is the break even price. So offshore versus onshore.

53
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.299
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: ye? Yeah. And

54
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.290
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: yeah.

55
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:06.140
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: So here's an article that says, I mean, this actually claims that offshore is cheaper than onshore. This might not be in the Us. Though

56
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.630
what

57
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.919
Karen Legotte: Us. Bill is like $85 and

58
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.900
Karen Legotte: Foxtel was like

59
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.000
35

60
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.880
Karen Legotte: Saudi Arabia was like $26.

61
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:29.759
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: I think it really depends. Right? Okay, so this says, the offshore break even price.

62
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.199
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: This was written in 2023 and says the offshore break, even price is $40

63
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.819
Karen Legotte: 40 bucks. That's

64
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.329
much better than onshore. Say, what does it say

65
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.140
Karen Legotte: when it's updated? Because I think my numbers might be a little stale.

66
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.179
II just I think you're right that we have to like. It really changes so fast

67
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:59.230
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: that it's it's hard to to PIN down. I think the important part is just that while offshore wasn't competitive

68
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.290
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: 5 years ago. And shale, you know, kind of

69
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.949
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: replace that that it is competitive. Now.

70
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.830
Karen Legotte: what about the environmental aspect of that.

71
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.050
Karen Legotte: Is that a big hurdle?

72
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:24.409
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: II don't. You I mean Charles and Birmingham, I think, are much deeper into this than I am. I talked to them, and then I talked to a friend of mine who's a

73
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:29.559
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: All he does is energy investing in in Louisiana runs a little hedge fund.

74
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:37.209
Karen Legotte: and he's the person who told me that that one of the important things to pay attention to is that the break even price for offshore has come down so much.

75
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:48.370
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: He also said, this one diamond which I'm thinking about buying. He likes better than see drill and rag.

76
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.549
Karen Legotte: one diamond it's called. No, it's called diamond. The ticker's Dl.

77
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:03.180
Karen Legotte: do they grow like anything like like in our wheelhouse about these oil goes to 120 they'll grow.

78
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.250
Karen Legotte: Thanks, though.

79
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:17.650
James Deutsch: I mean they're not gonna add new ships. They're gonna grow. The rate at which they charge for their services. If there's increased demand for it.

80
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:25.220
James Deutsch: Alex was saying that there aren't enough, so they'll have to charge more for the ones they have.

81
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.949
Karen Legotte: But is that gonna increase capacity. That was

82
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:40.219
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: th. The idea would be that the day rate day rate doubles

83
00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.010
we are.

84
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:52.590
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: And so they sign these long term contracts with the drilling companies, the companies looking for oil and that they get, you know, twice as much

85
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.519
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: per day. For the rigs in 2025 as they do today.

86
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.280
Karen Legotte: Most contracts are canceled. no prices come down and

87
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.430
Karen Legotte: cancel.

88
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.489
James Deutsch: I mean, you're making a

89
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.930
tactical bet on a near term increase

90
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.260
James Deutsch: in offshore

91
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.220
James Deutsch: drilling. I mean. I

92
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.149
James Deutsch: I'm I'm trying to distill the bed down to to something simple.

93
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:39.129
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Yeah, I'm making a bet that

94
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.659
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: that. Yes, I'm making a bet that

95
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.400
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: that.

96
00:10:48.510 --> 00:11:07.050
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: a lot of oil companies wanna make more money in 2026 and 27 and 28. And to do that, they need to invest in finding more oil in 2024 and 2025, and that Charles, is texting me.

97
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:19.840
James Deutsch: I don't know why he's not just talking. How does this industry works? Someone at Bp. Is now looking at an offshore project that they just got seismic back on for 2025.

98
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:34.140
James Deutsch: And they're calling all the people. And someone saying does not enough rigs out there. And so they're saying, Okay, well, don't order the pipe yet. Let me talk to the rig, Guy, and they're signing now affirm contract for rigs at a certain rate in 2025.

99
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:58.449
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Yeah, so like that right? Some of the stuff about this diamond one Charles, is texting me at, are you here, Charles? Okay. So I will read Charles's text, messages offshore G. Offshore gains share or production, and there've been no investment in offshore infrastructure for a decade. And yeah, so like Diamond, who I was reading about?

100
00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:19.019
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: They they're signing like like they've got. They'll only have 6 rigs, and so they're they're signing, you know, like commitments for people to take those rigs for like a hundred days in 2024. And they're filling out this dance card, and you know somebody wants the rig in Nigeria, and then somebody else wants it in the Gulf of Mexico, and they're booked. They're booked through 24.

101
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:29.580
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: They are booked through 24 at rates that are significantly higher than this year, and massively higher than 2 years ago.

102
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:35.310
James Deutsch: And and your bet, then, is that in 24

103
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.830
James Deutsch: they will take bookings for 25 at higher rates. Still.

104
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:53.129
James Deutsch: that's that's what that's gonna trade on. Because if 25 is below 24. They're not gonna care that there are any more in 24. So you're betting that a number of projects are gonna get greenlit in 24

105
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.850
James Deutsch: that are at higher rates than the commitments for 24.

106
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.430
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Yeah.

107
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.110
Yaroslav: Can't help, but

108
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:10.589
Yaroslav: by mine travel back to 2,008 when

109
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:19.350
Yaroslav: oil was going up every day. and the economy was flowing rapidly.

110
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:26.270
Yaroslav: And and is is this some sort of anticipation of earnings power that even

111
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:39.700
Yaroslav:  device? So by constraining supply that supply supply would be constraint. Not that the rig level even, but you know, even though they they'll start

112
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:48.360
Yaroslav:  exploration or production offshore, that they're still going. They're not gonna produce too much

113
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.529
Yaroslav: right? Is this some sort of anticipation of.

114
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:59.370
Yaroslav: you know, price increases in the face of generally kind of broad, slowdown.

115
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.220
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: This.

116
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.110
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: I think that there's

117
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.190
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: 3 aspects to this.

118
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:18.820
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: there's a whole lot less competition now than there was, and regulations have made it very difficult to create more competition

119
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:24.239
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: demand the the the big thing you've gotta believe, which is probably the thing that I'm

120
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:43.809
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: the most worried about is that demand for oil isn't gonna fall off a cliff because of people moving to Evs, etc., etc., etc., faster than expected. Right, they have visibility from their customers about likely

121
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.239
Yaroslav: demand. No, nobody knows what demand for oil is going to be next year. I mean, you just answered that

122
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.739
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: we've no idea what the economy in China is going to be next year.

123
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.859
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Nobody knows what their their cost. Nobody can tell you what demand for oil is going to be next year.

124
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.890
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: If they could, then they'd retire. Right?

125
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:06.930
Yaroslav: Well.

126
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.670
hmm!

127
00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:18.090
James Deutsch: I would propose you and panelists subcommittee to discuss making cyclical commodity trades.

128
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:26.940
Yaroslav: II the only the only data we have is how the stuff created in 2,008,

129
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:41.160
James Deutsch: I mean, on on the contrary, you have 100 years of data. You have 4,000 people working at every commodity hedge fund and market maker and long term hedging options. Retailer the

130
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.770
James Deutsch: there's there's no shortage of data here.

131
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.310
Karen Legotte: Exactly.

132
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:54.510
Yaroslav: That's right. No. But point that I have is that oil traded wildly bullish way.

133
00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:07.680
James Deutsch: But that's all. It's point. There's nobody could predict anything. You have a thousand people running in circles, chasing their tail, analyzing all the data, and they can't make any sense of it. So we're not really at any disadvantage, even though we don't know anything either.

134
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.350
Right?

135
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:26.610
James Deutsch: Crazy things happen. Oil goes up, all goes down. Look at what happened. Interest rates. People don't, can't predict these things.

136
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.009
James Deutsch: It may be the case that

137
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:34.589
James Deutsch: oil stays higher for longer in that

138
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.600
James Deutsch: that's one bed and the other bed is that oil goes back down

139
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.910
Yaroslav: right?

140
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.589
James Deutsch: I mean that that's there's no.

141
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.139
James Deutsch: that's what that is. If oil goes down 15 points, the stocks are going down.

142
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.199
Yaroslav: So I'm wondering if this means

143
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.260
Yaroslav: if if oil does go up.

144
00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:22.119
James Deutsch: I don't think you need oil to go, I think if it just stays at this price, then you'll make whatever the curve has to do.

145
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.120
James Deutsch: I mean, I do. You want to predict it stays at this price?

146
00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.190
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: I don't want to predict the price of oil.

147
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.059
James Deutsch: Well, I'm not

148
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.309
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: II, my bet is that I'm making an asymmetric bet.

149
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:55.919
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: My my bad is that I believe that the price that the price of oil, the market to be efficient about the price of oil, and all of the risks from the market in China, and all of this other stuff are accurately forecast and

150
00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:13.209
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: and but further down the supply chain. There are reasons that the economic return of these businesses that provide this asset required in order to create more supply which will be necessary. Are are mispriced.

151
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:27.899
Yaroslav: I think that if I knew that the demand for my commodity product was going to go down. I would try to produce less of my commodity

152
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.840
Yaroslav: and keep my prices higher.

153
00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.649
James Deutsch: Okay, there's a

154
00:18:33.530 --> 00:19:03.529
James Deutsch: you're a tiny part of a giant market. There's 1,000 people trying to figure out exactly, how does Saudi Arabia interact with this? How does individual oil company be interact with this? What all of those companies are doing is saying, Hey, we have this field here that has assets there. How much will it cost us to develop it? What might we be able to get for those for that product. Well, that's why they're partel right? So that they can do the same thing in unison.

155
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.180
Yaroslav: They decide.

156
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.429
Yaroslav: oh, demand is going down.

157
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:21.150
Yaroslav: So I'm going to make sure that my prices are high for the people that can't live without my commodity. Right? But that might be very good for the company's. Alex is betting on, because

158
00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:34.300
Yaroslav: asking about the implication on the rest of the economy, that what this actually their action may be signaling that the rest of the economy. The consumers of the users of oil are actually in trouble

159
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.389
Yaroslav: that they're signaling lower demand.

160
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.050
Yaroslav: and they're seeing prices being increased on them

161
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.279
James Deutsch: not really.

162
00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:51.850
Charles Levy: I believe.

163
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.109
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Charles, text me, and I'll read it.

164
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:22.220
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Look, Yarrow, you might be right, and this is some, you know, Knight's Templar conspiracy, and there really is a secret society manipulating entire world economy. I'm certainly willing to believe that it's true. I think it's really hard for people to keep secrets and

165
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:28.029
Yaroslav: and I'm manipulating. They're simply responding to the economic signals they see.

166
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.509
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Okay, well. I'm not even sure what we're arguing.

167
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.090
James Deutsch: They're discussing. Well, II think what

168
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:47.470
James Deutsch: might be saying, and it comports with some of the things they've read is that you know, Saudi Arabia is cutting production of oil, keeping price high

169
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.320
James Deutsch: because

170
00:20:49.510 --> 00:21:08.280
James Deutsch: they have economists, or whatever are worried that they're seeing less, demand long term, demand from their customers less people showing up and saying, Hey, give us 5 years of oil, 3 years of oil. And so they're worried about demand in the midterm. And so they're cutting prices to keep cutting

171
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.539
James Deutsch: production now to keep prices high.

172
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:20.250
Yaroslav: That's right, that's exactly right, and that when that and then, when that softness shows, there'll be nothing they can do to protect the price.

173
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:31.969
James Deutsch: because the cartel will break. and they will need the money for tax revenue and all of that, and they'll end up pumping more at 60 than they're pumping now at 90 to balance their budget.

174
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.620
James Deutsch: Totally plausible theory. Totally

175
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.900
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: totally.

176
00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:48.650
James Deutsch: Saudi Arabia certainly has a team of economists that's trying to predict what's the best strategy for the country, based on the demand that they see. And and they have lots of demand information

177
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:56.749
James Deutsch: about a factor here that wants 3 years of this many barrels, and you know people do sign long term supply agreements.

178
00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:58.740
Yaroslav: That's right.

179
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:20.339
James Deutsch: I remember when you guys had a healthcare call that started at 8 45. Is it? Is it time to start a commodities call that starts at 8 30?

180
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.900
Okay.

181
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.899
James Deutsch: what else do we have?

182
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:52.529
James Deutsch: Yeah, I'll be in the office later today I went to the Big Solar Conference in Las Vegas yesterday. How was that?

183
00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.340
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: It's a mess.

184
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.419
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: It's a lot going on

185
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.410
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: the

186
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:13.009
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: II mean, the European people had thought the European market was gonna grow 50%. It's you know, they're now saying, maybe 30% is better.

187
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:17.650
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co:  The result of that is that the

188
00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:26.399
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: inventory channel for panels. So panels were, in short supply. So everybody overword panels, and all of these distributors

189
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:44.939
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: have way more panels than they need, and then the price of panels in Europe went from 55 cents a watt to 35 cents a watt, and so all of these distributors are underwater on their panels and are suffering from significant cash crunches.

190
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:55.349
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co:  And then, you know, the Europeans kind of like figured out the power problem from Russia, and this is like less of a crunch than it was. How how do they figure that out?

191
00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:59.939
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: I haven't really looked into it.

192
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.979
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: I my guess is that

193
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.009
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: that a lot of it was

194
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:13.259
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: people worry that the the fear was ahead of the reality.

195
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.160
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: But

196
00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:20.920
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: they blew up a pipeline.

197
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:26.379
James Deutsch: They've gotten 0 gas from Russia since, whenever

198
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.460
James Deutsch: and what what has Russia been doing with its gas

199
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:40.349
Yaroslav: India and China? They're selling to India, and they can't pipe it to either India or China. So I think they're just not selling it.

200
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.190
Yaroslav: They're they're sending ships to India.

201
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:48.950
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: There's not liquification capacity in Russia to do much of that.

202
00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.529
Yaroslav: Wow! I guess

203
00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.390
Eric Domb: they have some new facility up in the North.

204
00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:04.960
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: I I'm sure they do. I think it's also a very small percentage of what they have been sending to Europe. I know they're building a pipeline to China, but it's gonna take like 10 years or something.

205
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:13.489
Yaroslav: I think there's a small existing month to China. It's very small. But so Germany has. I think in 2,018

206
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:21.220
Yaroslav: 2019, they actually put in the line to carry electricity from the Northern States, where they have the the wind.

207
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.979
Yaroslav: the Northern territory

208
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:32.920
Yaroslav: down south down to where there are factories. So there's some very small amount of

209
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.820
Yaroslav: a manager that's introduce.

210
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.130
Yaroslav: That, you know. Probably account probably

211
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:47.159
Yaroslav: accounts for the fact that prices oh, just the prices didn't have to rise so much

212
00:25:47.210 --> 00:26:14.830
James Deutsch: gas and oil.

213
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:28.740
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: They don't seem to be freaking out about it, and they probably also got people to, you know, price signals, and whatever other conservation mechanisms they have got people to cut back demand to the point that they figured out

214
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.550
James Deutsch: how much were they getting from Germany?

215
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.350
James Deutsch: From Russia? I'm sorry from Russia. Yeah.

216
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.930
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: a lot.

217
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:45.490
Yaroslav: We're probably getting half of their need of their natural gas needs. But natural gas is probably 30 after a total.

218
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:55.169
James Deutsch: So 15 conservation.

219
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:59.830
Yaroslav: And with us sense of being right.

220
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:05.719
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: So it was 83% of its natural gas from Russia.

221
00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:26.360
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: So before the war it was 83%. And so just for electricity generation

222
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:32.929
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: was 20%. Natural gas in Europe. And then heating would be another big slug.

223
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.890
James Deutsch: I see. So 15% of electricity

224
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.250
James Deutsch: had to be offset.

225
00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:45.159
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Yeah, here is a graph but then the heating is probably

226
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.449
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: at least that much as well.

227
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:57.020
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: 2 thirds of Europe's energy was made by burning fossil fuels, 34% gas, so 34%

228
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:06.309
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: of 34% of European energy was gas and 83% of that was Russia. So yeah, that gets you right about 15%.

229
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.090
James Deutsch: So

230
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:28.129
James Deutsch: what how? What is this doing for you with respect to various solar investments? Well, that's not the only thing that's going on.

231
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.070
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: the

232
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.210
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: so the Pete, like Solar edge. Who's, you know.

233
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:48.229
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: pretty deep. So then, the other thing that's happening in Europe is that the Chinese have really been ramping supply into the European market for both panels and inverters.

234
00:28:48.310 --> 00:29:02.799
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: and like Solar Edge claims that they're gonna be fine because nobody in Europe wants to install a Chinese inferver because somebody China can turn off their energy. Which

235
00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:08.299
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: doesn't seem like it's gonna work out very well.

236
00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:33.880
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: And you know, they say, well, you know, we don't really compete with those people, because all the distributors is exactly what they said. All the distributors have like a premium line, and then they have, like a non premium line, and we only compete in the premium line. So we're really only competing with end phase. And we don't compete with all these other people. But that. And it just doesn't seem like that's gonna work right? Like you know, more people will just do the less premium thing. And you know, sure you can have

237
00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:38.380
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: premium premium will shrink as there's more competition.

238
00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:40.879
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: so that's

239
00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:48.830
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Europe is probably more going on in Europe. The Us. Market is very confusing.

240
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.350
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: The the question is about

241
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.439
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: how much growth there's gonna be next year.

242
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:11.820
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Solar Edge, who doesn't have a big Us. Business, says that the markets not gonna in the Us. Isn't gonna grow at all. Next year.  And

243
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:28.050
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: they say it'll be 5 or 6 quarters before the market grows in the Us. Because at the higher interest rates solar just doesn't make sense in the Us. Because electricity prices aren't high enough.

244
00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:39.059
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: The other companies and I talked to a whole bunch of them sunpower, Taigo, maxion, and phase, probably some other ones

245
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:56.760
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: who are mix of installers and suppliers. You know. They point to things like these very steep electricity, and I've got a whole list of like how much electricity prices have gone up around the country, and I'll share in a couple of minutes they point to how fast electricity prices have gone up

246
00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:15.480
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: and the inflation reduction act and say, Well, look that more than makes up for any increase in interest rates? And you know you, if you're buying solar in California right now, it's a 5 year payback in San Diego, it's 3 so what's the problem?

247
00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:23.819
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: so that's the Us. Market. it's definitely not like

248
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:31.850
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Q. 3 is going to be bad for everybody in the Us. Market, and maybe Q. 4. And

249
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:47.860
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: the question is, if you know, is flat, sequentially, which would be a good result because it's usually down or if people don't figure out how to sell solar in the United States. With all these new programs.

250
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.429
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: I got a little bit more clarity on

251
00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:53.930
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: what's going on with sunrun. The

252
00:31:54.700 --> 00:32:08.240
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: so this came from Sonova, which is sun, runs probably the largest competitor, I mean, they're a small fraction of the size. But the government the way the Government's intention with all of these adders. So the Ira.

253
00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:26.840
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: the Ira has you know, it was 26% Itc 2 years ago, and the Ira expanded the Itc to 30% if your third party ownership and extended it for 10 years, and then they also added a bunch of adders and their

254
00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:31.469
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: probably more. But there's 4 that I remember off the top of my head, one's domestic content.

255
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:54.059
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: The other one's an energy community which means that, like some percentage of people historically worked in energy. So it's like all of Houston, it's like tons of things that you wouldn't like New Jersey counts because there's like refineries there. It's like tons of areas. And and that there's a map that Treasury gave. And it's like, you know, anything within this map counts so that one's really easy and people are getting that. Then there's this low income adder

256
00:32:54.120 --> 00:33:00.159
James Deutsch: and when you say adder, you mean percentage of the install costs that the government covers

257
00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:27.960
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: correct, and they cover that in a tax credit. And and then the other thing is the third party ownership. People when they flip it to the tax equity. And this has always been this way, and this has been litigated, and it's totally gross. And I completely agree. But it's been this way, you know. Solarcity was, you know, had their offices turned over by the FBI. It was litigated blah blah blah blah blah, but they turn it over to the third party ownership the tax equity flip people at the fair market value. So they're not getting

258
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:34.080
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: 40%. They're not getting under the regular Itc, they're not getting 30% of the cost. They're getting 30% of what

259
00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:41.810
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: they got. Somebody to say was the fair market value which you can believe is significantly higher than

260
00:33:42.400 --> 00:34:06.129
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: than what they actually spent on the cost. So you know, if they did it for 3 80, maybe they're claiming the fair market value is 4, 80. And so they're getting, you know, 30% of 480. And then with the adders, you can pretty easily get. You know, 40% of the fair market value, which you know is well, north of 50% of the actual cost.

261
00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:20.119
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: and so, okay. But but what's happened is that the that, except for the energy communities adder, all of the other ones were written in such a way that

262
00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.769
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Treasury hasn't

263
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:39.259
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: figured out how to issue the description of what they are, and in some cases where the intent of the bill had been to make them retroactive. People are really concerned that they're not gonna be able to get retroactive.

264
00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:54.709
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Ira credits. So that was my interest in Sun Run was and continues to be really that you know, they're gonna get the government to pay for over 50% of these things on day one. And

265
00:34:55.020 --> 00:35:02.120
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: they, you know. Say, they're going to be able to generate 500 million dollars in like actual free cash flow

266
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.290
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: sometime starting sometime next year.

267
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:17.529
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: but it sounds like the implementation of these bills and the the you know, and how long it's taking the Treasury Department to issue any kind of clarity is really modeling that.

268
00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:26.800
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: And it's it's worse than Sunrun had thought. And, in fact, like, according to Sonova, Sunrun was

269
00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:49.159
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: quoting prices to people assuming that Treasury would get this sorted out in 6 months. And now it looks like it's not gonna be 6 months. It's gonna be, you know, 9 or 12 months. And it might not be retroactive, and sun runs upset because they're like, look we did, dear Treasury Department. We did what you said you wanted. You know, but this is a mess. So I think that's

270
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:52.680
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: probably one of the things that's going on in the sun run.

271
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:04.130
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Everybody is super negative on the entire space. Like I.

272
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.740
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: The the sentiment is just terrible.

273
00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:16.109
James Deutsch: Sounds like you should buy solar in short oil.

274
00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:17.920
Alex Derbes - Gilder Gagnon Howe & Co: Probably

275
00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:22.949
James Deutsch: that's kind of what I was thinking to. Alright if you want to read the list.

276
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:35.669
Eric Domb: Birmingham soul. Most of the American Tower sort of Getty Cormac shorted Oxford industries

277
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:43.929
Eric Domb:  guys the shorts and more. JP. Morgan.

278
00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.050
Eric Domb: That's it.

279
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.640
James Deutsch: Okay, thanks. Everyone.
